# BPC Projects
This repository is a collection of programs written  by me on BPC lessons on BUT (VUT Brno in Czech).
These programs are written in C/C++, task description is included in each project folder when possible.

## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. 

### Prerequisites
To compile these projects yourself you will need Visual Studio 2015 or 2017, newer should work too.
If you use different version of Visual Studio, you will need to change some project settings:

 - Windows SDK Version
 - Platform Toolset

Both can be found Project->Properties.
